# Introduction of dataset

The dataset is Video Games Sales data, spanning from 1980 to 2020 (there were insufficient data from 2017 to 2020). Being someone who loves video games even made me more curious and eager to unveil the mysteries of the dataset.

# Data Cleaning, analysis and visualization**

Firstly, I checked for duplicates and found none. I got rid of missing values in some of the columns(Year and Platform). I went ahead to format the columns appropriately. I run a descriptive analysis on the data to get the summary statistics. I used pivot tables and pivot charts for my visualization. I also made use of slicers so I can filter my charts when I want to.

# Business Insights, Decision-making and Conclusion**

North America had the highest total global sales of games with 4.3B (49%), contributing to almost half of the 8.8B total global sales of all games across all regions. Followed by Europe with 2.4B(27%).

The game called Wii Sports which was published by Nintendo in the year 2006 recorded global sales of 83M.

Action, Sports, Shooter and Role playing are the top 4 genres that recorded the highest total global sales of games. Business leaders and Game makers can target these Genres when making games.

The scatter plot shows high relationship between platform popularity and sales. Game makers might want to release their games on platforms like PS2, PS3,DS,Wii and X360 as they are the most used platforms hence recording high sales.

Action, Sports and Shooter are the top 3 genres in sales across all regions except in Japan. Recording the lowest sales for Action and Shooter and the second lowest in Sports. The Highest selling genre in Japan is Role playing. Therefore, business leaders in the gaming industry looking to target the Japanese market should consider releasing a Role playing game. To even maximize sales to the highest capacity in Japan, Game makers should consider releasing games on DS and PS2 since they are the top 2 most used platforms in Japan and also the platforms that records very high sales in Japan.

Game publishers targeting high sales globally might want to be careful when releasing Strategic genre games since it is the lowest selling genre of all-time.

2008 is the year the total global sales of games peaked, recording an all-time high of 678M. Since hitting this huge figure in 2008, total global sales of games have seen a huge decline. From the global sales trend, it can be seen that sales kept decreasing after 2008 till it hit a total global sales of 363M in 2013,gaining a little increase in 2014 with 368M and then went ahead to decrease further throughout the subsequent years
